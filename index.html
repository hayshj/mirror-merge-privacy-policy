      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how the <strong>Mirror Merge</strong> mobile
        application handles information. The app does not require an account and
        does not directly collect personal information such as names or email
        addresses.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We do not directly collect personal information. However, the app uses
        third-party advertising services (Google AdMob), which may automatically
        collect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
        <li>Approximate location (country or region)</li>
        <li>App usage and interaction data</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Information Is Used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To display advertisements</li>
        <li>To measure ad performance</li>
        <li>To improve app stability and user experience</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Mirror Merge uses Google AdMob. Google’s use of data is governed by its
        own privacy policy:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          https://policies.google.com/privacy
        </a>
      </p>

      <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
      <p>
        Game progress and high scores are stored locally on your device and are
        not transmitted to our servers.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Choices</h2>
      <p>
        You may limit ad personalization through your device settings. On iOS,
        you may deny tracking permission. Ads may still be shown but will be less
        personalized.
      </p>

      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Mirror Merge is not intended for children under the age of 13 and does not
        knowingly collect personal data from children.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        This policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted
        on this page with an updated effective date.
      </p>
